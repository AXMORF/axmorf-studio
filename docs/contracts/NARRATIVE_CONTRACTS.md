# Narrative Contracts v1

## Persisted source files

- `brief.json` → `VideoBriefSchema`
- `story.json` → `StorySpecSchema`
- `narration.json` → `NarrationSpecSchema`
- `render.json` → `RenderSpecSchema`
- `generated/sealed-narration.generated.json` → `SealedNarrationManifestSchema`
- `generated/semantic-timing.generated.json` → `SemanticTimingSchema`

The first four files are authored source; the two `generated/` files are derived artifacts. All
objects are strict and use `schemaVersion: 1`.

## Identity

`storyId` is the lowercase filesystem slug and becomes `StoryCompositionProps.projectId`.
`meaningId` is unique per StorySpec. `chunkId` is unique across the complete StorySpec.
Array order is semantic order; no independent numeric order field exists.

## Authored narration

`ttsChunks` are authored units and are never split mechanically. An explicit pause is declared by
`{afterChunkId, pauseMs}` in its owning StoryBeat, where `pauseMs` is a non-negative integer. A zero
pause remains an owned zero-length timeline segment; a positive pause must quantize to at least one PCM
sample frame. Pause declarations are excluded from the generation input fingerprint but included in the
sealed narration fingerprint.

## Fingerprints

`sha256-canonical-json-v1` recursively sorts object keys, preserves array order, rejects non-JSON
values, and hashes a domain-separated `{namespace, value, version}` envelope as UTF-8 SHA-256.

## Sealed narration

`SealedNarrationManifestSchema` records the selected normalized chunk artifacts, explicit pause
segments, canonical PCM format, complete WAV metadata, checksums, generation input fingerprint, and
sealed narration fingerprint. M1 validates metadata only; M2 performs real file measurement and sealing.

## Semantic timing

`pcm-cumulative-ceil-v1` builds one cumulative integer sample timeline and applies
`ceilDiv(samples × fps, sampleRate)` at shared boundaries with `BigInt`. CaptionCue is one-to-one with
TTSChunk. Explicit pauses have timing but no CaptionCue. RenderSpec timing fields are `fps`,
`leadInFrames`, and `tailFrames`.

## M1 command

```bash
npm test
```
